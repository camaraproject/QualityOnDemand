## Release Notes

This public release contains the definition and documentation of
* [quality-on-demand v1.0.0](#quality-on-demand-v100)
* [qos-profiles v1.0.0](#qos-profiles-v100)
* [qod-provisioning v0.2.0](#qod-provisioning-v020)

The API definition(s) are based on
* Commonalities v0.5.0
* Identity and Consent Management v0.3.0

## quality-on-demand v1.0.0

**quality-on-demand v1.0.0 is the public release of the first stable version 1.0.0 of the API**

Version 1.0.0 provides the QoS Sessions endpoints from v0.11.1, and is aligned with Commonalities 0.5 and Identity and Consent Management 0.3. 

**There are breaking changes compared to v0.11.1.**: the API use has been simplified for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API. In these cases the optional `device` parameter MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token. In this context also some error response codes have been renamed or replaced to comply with Commonalities 0.5. With the change to a stable API version also the version of the event type has been changed to v1 in org.camaraproject.quality-on-demand.v1.qos-status-changed

# v0.1.0 - Initial contribution

**Initial contribution of two API definitions for Quality on Demand (stable bandwidth and stable latency)**, including initial documentation and implementation code.

## Please note 
- this "release" is only tagged to document the history of the API, it is not intended to be used by implementors or API customers
- it was implemented by Deutsche Telekom within lab environment and tested against two NEF implementations
- going forward the implementation [code](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/tree/50e81e0c4a6a7431c0a7f50c26415caf935be6df/code/API_code) will not be part of releases of QoD API. Instead it will be provided within separate repositories (QualityOnDemand_PIx).
