Feature: CAMARA Quality On Demand API, v1.1.0 - Operation retrieveSessionsByDevice
  # Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
  #
  # Implementation indications:
  # * apiRoot: API root of the server URL
  # * List of device identifier types which are not supported, among: phoneNumber, ipv4Address, ipv6Address.
  #   For this version, CAMARA does not allow the use of networkAccessIdentifier, so it is considered by default as not supported.
  #
  # Testing assets:
  # * A device object applicable for Quality On Demand service with an QoS Sessions associated, and the request properties used for createSession
  # * A device object applicable for Quality On Demand service with NO QoS Sessions associated
  # * A device object identifying a device commercialized by the implementation for which the service is not applicable, if any.
  #
  # References to OAS spec schemas refer to schemas specified in quality-on-demand.yaml

  Background: Common retrieveSessionsByDevice setup
    Given an environment at "apiRoot"
    And the resource "/quality-on-demand/v1/retrieve-sessions"
    And the header "Content-Type" is set to "application/json"
    And the header "Authorization" is set to a valid access token
    And the header "x-correlator" complies with the schema at "#/components/schemas/XCorrelator"
    # Properties not explicitly overwritten in the Scenarios can take any values compliant with the schema
    And the request body is set by default to a request body compliant with the schema at "/components/schemas/RetrieveSessionsInput"

  # Success scenarios

  @quality_on_demand_retrieveSessionsByDevice_01_get_existing_session_by_device
  Scenario: Get an existing QoD session by device
    Given a valid testing device supported by the service, identified by the token or provided in the request body, with QoS active sessions associated
    When the request "retrieveSessionsByDevice" is sent
    Then the response status code is 200
    And the response header "Content-Type" is "application/json"
    And the response header "x-correlator" has same value as the request header "x-correlator"
    # The response has to comply with the generic response schema which is part of the spec
    And the response body complies with the OAS schema at "/components/schemas/RetrieveSessionsOutput"
    # Additionally any success response has to comply with some constraints beyond the schema compliance
    And in all items in the response, property "device" exists only if provided for createSession and with the same value
    And in all items in the response, property "applicationServer" has the same value as in the request body
    And in all items in the response, property "qosProfile" has the value provided for createSession
    And in all items in the response, property "devicePorts" exists only if provided for createSession and with the same value
    And in all items in the response, property "applicationServerPorts" exists only if provided for createSession and with the same value
    And in all items in the response, property "sink" exists only if provided for createSession and with the same value
    # sinkCredential not explicitly mentioned to be returned if present, as this is debatable for security concerns
    And in all items in the response, property "startedAt" exists only if "qosStatus" is "AVAILABLE" and the value is in the past
    And in all items in the response, property "expiresAt" exists only if "qosStatus" is not "REQUESTED" and the value is later than "startedAt"
    And in all items in the response, property "statusInfo" exists only if "qosStatus" is "UNAVAILABLE"
