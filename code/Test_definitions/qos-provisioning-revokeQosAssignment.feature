Feature: CAMARA QoS Provisioning API, v0.3.0 - Operation revokeQosAssignment
  # Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
  #
  # Implementation indications:
  # * apiRoot: API root of the server URL
  #
  # Testing assets:
  # * The AssignmentInfo of an existing QoS assignment
  # * The AssignmentInfo of an existing QoS assignment with status "AVAILABLE", and with provided values for "sink" and "sinkCredential"
  #
  # References to OAS spec schemas refer to schemas specified in qos-provisioning.yaml

  Background: Common revokeQosAssignment setup
    Given an environment at "apiRoot"
    And the resource "/qos-provisioning/v0.3/qos-assignments/{assignmentId}"
    # Unless indicated otherwise the QoS assignment must be created by the same API client given in the access token
    And the header "Authorization" is set to a valid access token granted to the same client that created the QoS assignment
    And the header "x-correlator" complies with the schema at "#/components/schemas/XCorrelator"
    And the path parameter "assignmentId" is set by default to an existing QoS assignment ID

  # Success scenarios

  @qos_provisioning_revokeQosAssignment_01_delete_existing_qos_assignment_sync
  Scenario: Delete an existing QoS assignment synchronously
    Given that implementation deletes QoS assignment synchronously
    And an existing QoS assignment created by operation createQosAssignment
    And the path parameter "assignmentId" is set to the value for that QoS assignment
    When the request "revokeQosAssignment" is sent
