Feature: CAMARA Quality On Demand API, v1.1.0 - Operation getSession
  # Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
  #
  # Implementation indications:
  # * apiRoot: API root of the server URL
  #
  # Testing assets:
  # * The sessionId of an existing QoS session, and the request properties used for createSession
  #
  # References to OAS spec schemas refer to schemas specifies in quality-on-demand.yaml

  Background: Common getSession setup
    Given an environment at "apiRoot"
    And the resource "/quality-on-demand/v1/sessions/{sessionId}"
    # Unless indicated otherwise the session must be created by the same API client given in the access token
    And the header "Authorization" is set to a valid access token
    And the header "x-correlator" complies with the schema at "#/components/schemas/XCorrelator"
    And the path parameter "sessionId" is set by default to a existing QoS session sessionId

  # Success scenarios

  @quality_on_demand_getSession_01_get_existing_session
  Scenario: Get an existing QoD session by sessionId
    Given an existing QoS session created by operation createSession
    And the path parameter "sessionId" is set to the value for that QoS session
    When the request "getSession" is sent
    Then the response status code is 200
    And the response header "x-correlator" has same value as the request header "x-correlator"
    # The response has to comply with the generic response schema which is part of the spec
    And the response body complies with the OAS schema at "#/components/schemas/SessionInfo"
    # Additionally any success response has to comply with some constraints beyond the schema compliance
    And the response property "$.device" exists only if provided for createSession and with the same value
    And the response property "$.applicationServer" has the same value as in the request body
    And the response property "$.qosProfile" has the value provided for createSession
    And the response property "$.devicePorts" exists only if provided for createSession and with the same value
    And the response property "$.applicationServerPorts" exists only if provided for createSession and with the same value
    And the response property "$.sink" exists only if provided for createSession and with the same value
    # sinkCredential not explicitly mentioned to be returned if present, as this is debatable for security concerns
    And the response property "$.startedAt" exists only if "$.qosStatus" is "AVAILABLE" and the value is in the past
    And the response property "$.expiresAt" exists only if "$.qosStatus" is not "REQUESTED" and the value is later than "$.startedAt"
    And the response property "$.statusInfo" exists only if "$.qosStatus" is "UNAVAILABLE"

  @quality_on_demand_getSession_02_get_recent_unavailable
  Scenario: QOS Session becoming "UNAVAILABLE" is not released for at least 360 seconds
    Given an existing QoS session failed to be created in the last 360 seconds
    And the path parameter "sessionId" is set to the value for that QoS session
    When the request "getSession" is sent
    Then the response status code is 200
    And the response header "Content-Type" is "application/json"
    And the response header "x-correlator" has same value as the request header "x-correlator"
    And the response body complies with the OAS schema at "#/components/schemas/SessionInfo"
    And the response property "$.status" is "UNAVAILABLE"

  # Errors 400

  # 400 errors are not expected for this operation unless the implementation validates the format of sessionId
  # 404 NOT_FOUND is an alternative if path parameter format is not validated
  @quality_on_demand_getSession_400.1_invalid_session_id
  Scenario: Invalid Argument. Generic Syntax Exception
    Given the path parameter "sessionId" has not a UUID format
    When the request "getSession" is sent
    Then the response status code is 400

    And the response header "Content-Type" is "application/json"
    And the response property "$.status" is 400
    And the response property "$.code" is "INVALID_ARGUMENT"
    And the response property "$.message" contains a user friendly text

  # Generic 401 errors

  Scenario: Error response for no header "Authorization"
    Given the header "Authorization" is not sent

    Then the response status code is 401
    And the response header "x-correlator" has same value as the request header "x-correlator"
    And the response header "Content-Type" is "application/json"
    And the response property "$.status" is 401
    And the response property "$.code" is "UNAUTHENTICATED"
