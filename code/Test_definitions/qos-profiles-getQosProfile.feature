Feature: CAMARA QoS Profiles API, vwip - Operation getQosProfile
  # Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
  #
  # Implementation indications:
  # * apiRoot: API root of the server URL
  #
  # Testing assets:
  # * The name of an existing QoS profile
  #
  # References to OAS spec schemas refer to schemas specified in qos-profiles.yaml

  Background: Common getQosProfile setup
    Given an environment at "apiRoot"
    And the resource "/qos-profiles/vwip/qos-profiles/{name}"
    And the header "Authorization" is set to a valid access token
    And the header "x-correlator" complies with the schema at "#/components/schemas/XCorrelator"
    And the path param "name" is set by default to an existing QoS profile name

  # Success scenarios

  @qos_profiles_getQosProfile_01_generic_success_scenario
  Scenario: Common validations for any success scenario
    # Valid testing device and default request body compliant with the schema
    Given an existing QoS profile

    And the response header "x-correlator" has same value as the request header "x-correlator"
    And each item of the response array complies with the OAS schema at "/components/schemas/QosProfile"
    And the response property "$.name" value is equal to path param "name"
    # TBC: Add additional constraints, such as max* properties must be higher than min* equivalent properties, etc

  # Errors 400
