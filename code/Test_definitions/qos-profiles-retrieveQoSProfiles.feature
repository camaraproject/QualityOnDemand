Feature: CAMARA QoS Profiles API, vwip - Operation retrieveQoSProfiles
    # Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
    #
    # Implementation indications:
    # * apiRoot: API root of the server URL
    # * List of device identifier types which are not supported, among: phoneNumber, ipv4Address, ipv6Address.
    #   For this version, CAMARA does not allow the use of networkAccessIdentifier, so it is considered by default as not supported.
    #
    # Testing assets:
    # * The name of an existing QoS profile
    # * If some QoS Profile is restricted for some devices, provide the QoS profile name and device
    # * A device object identifying a device commercialized by the implementation for which the service is not applicable, if any

    # References to OAS spec schemas refer to schemas specifies in qos-profiles.yaml
