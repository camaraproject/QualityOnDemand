Feature: CAMARA Quality On Demand API, vwip - Operation extendQosSessionDuration
    # Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
    #
    # Implementation indications:
    # * apiRoot: API root of the server URL
    #
    # Testing assets:
    # * The sessionId of an existing session with qosStatus "AVAILABLE"
    # * The sessionId of an existing session with qosStatus "UNAVAILABLE"
    #
    # References to OAS spec schemas refer to schemas specifies in quality-on-demand.yaml

  Background: Common extendQosSessionDuration setup
    Given an environment at "apiRoot"
    And the resource "/quality-on-demand/vwip/sessions/{sessionId}/extend"
    And the header "Content-Type" is set to "application/json"
    And the header "Authorization" is set to a valid access token
    And the header "x-correlator" is set to a UUID value
        # Properties not explicitly overwitten in the Scenarios can take any values compliant with the schema
    And the request body is set by default to a request body compliant with the schema at "/components/schemas/ExtendSessionDuration"
    And the path parameter "sessionId" is set by default to a existing QoS session sessionId
