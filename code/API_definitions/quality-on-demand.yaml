  title: Quality-On-Demand
  description: |
    The Quality-On-Demand (QoD) API provides programmable interface for developers and other users (capabilities consumers) to request stable latency or throughput managed by Telco networks without the necessity to have an in-depth knowledge of the 4G/5G system or the overall complexity of the Telecom Systems.

    # Introduction

    Industrial (IoT), VR/Gaming, live video streaming, autonomous driving and many other scenarios demand network communication quality and are sensitive to any change in transmission conditions. Being able to request a stable latency (reduced jitter) or prioritized throughput from the network can improve user experience substantially.

    The QoD API offers the application developers the capability to request for stable latency (reduced jitter) or throughput for some specified application data flows between application clients (within a user device) and Application Servers (backend services). The developer has a pre-defined set of Quality of Service (QoS) profiles which they could choose from depending on their latency or throughput requirements.

    ![QoD API Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/main/documentation/API_documentation/resources/QoD_latency_overview.PNG)

    The usage of the API is based on QoS session resources, which can be created (based on available QoS profiles), queried and deleted. The deletion of a requested session can be triggered by the API consumer or can be triggered automatically once the QoS session has reached its limit.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **QOD service endpoint**:
    The URL pointing to the RESTful resource of the QoD API.

    * **Authentication**:
    Security access keys such as OAuth 2.0 client credentials used by client applications to invoke the QoD API.

    * **QoS profiles and QoS profile labels**:
    Latency, throughput or priority requirements of the application mapped to relevant QoS profile values. The set of QoS Profiles that an operator is offering can be retrieved by means of the [QoS Profile API](link TBC).

    * **Identifier for the device**:
    At least one identifier for the device (user equipment) out of four options: IPv4 address, IPv6 address, Phone number, or Network Access Identifier assigned by the mobile network operator for the device. Note: Network Access Identifier is defined for future use and will not be supported with v0.11.0 of the API.

    * **Identifier for the application server**:
    IPv4 and/or IPv6 address of the application server (application backend)

    * **App-Flow (between the application client and application server)**:
    The precise application data flow the developer wants to prioritize and have stable latency or throughput for. This flow is in the current API version determined by the identifiers used for the device and the application server. And it can be further elaborated with details such as ports or port-ranges. Future version of the API might allow more detailed flow identification features.

    * **Duration**:
    Duration (in seconds) for which the QoS session (between application client and application server) should be created. Limits for session duration can be set by the implementation for the QoS profile. The user may request a termination before its expiration.

    * **Notification URL and token**:
    Developers may provide a callback URL on which notifications about all status change events of the session (eg. session termination) can be received from the service provider. This is an optional parameter.

    # API functionality

    The usage of the QoD API is based on QoS profile classes and parameters which define App-Flows.
    Based on the API, QoS session resources can be created, queried, and deleted. Once an offered QoS profile class is requested, application users get a prioritized service with stable latency or throughput even in the case of congestion. The QoD API has the following characteristics:

    * A specified App-Flow is prioritized to ensure stable latency or throughput for that flow.
    * The prioritized App-Flow is described by providing information such as device IP address (or other device identifier) & application server IP addresses and port/port-ranges.
    * The developer can optionally specify the duration for which they need the prioritized App-flow.
    * Stable latency or throughput is requested by selecting from the list of QoS profiles made available by the service provider (e.g. QOS_E) to map latency and throughput requirements.
    * The developer can optionally also specify callback URL on which notifications for the session can be sent. <br>

    Following diagram shows the interaction between different components

    ![QoD Management API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/main/documentation/API_documentation/resources/QoD_details.PNG)

    # Authorization and Authentication

    [Camara Security and Interoperability Profile](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-Security-Interoperability.md) provides details on how a client requests an access token.

    Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco Operator exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access tokens becomes mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in strict compliance with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric data control.

        Create QoS Session to manage latency/throughput priorities

        If the qosStatus in the API response is "AVAILABLE" and a notification callback is provided the client will receive in addition to the response a
        `QOS_STATUS_CHANGED` event notification with `qosStatus` as `AVAILABLE`.

        If the `qosStatus` in the API response is `REQUESTED`, the client will receive either
        - a `QOS_STATUS_CHANGED` event notification with `qosStatus` as `AVAILABLE` after the network notifies that it has created the requested session, or
        - a `QOS_STATUS_CHANGED` event notification with `qosStatus` as `UNAVAILABLE` and `statusInfo` as `NETWORK_TERMINATED` after the network notifies that it has failed to provide the requested session.

        A `QOS_STATUS_CHANGED` event notification with `qosStatus` as `UNAVAILABLE` will also be send if the network terminates the session before the requested duration expired

        **NOTES:**
        - In case of a `QOS_STATUS_CHANGED` event with `qosStatus` as `UNAVAILABLE` and `statusInfo` as `NETWORK_TERMINATED` the resources of the QoS session are not directly released, but will get deleted automatically at earliest 360 seconds after the event.

          This behavior allows clients which are not receiving notification events but are polling to get the session information with the `qosStatus` `UNAVAILABLE` and `statusInfo` `NETWORK_TERMINATED`. Before a client can attempt to create a new QoD session for the same device and flow period they must release the session resources with an explicit `delete` operation if not yet automatically deleted.
        - The access token may be either 2-legged or 3-legged. If a 3-legged access token is used, the end user identified by the `device` parameter must also be associated with the access token.

        Extend the overall session duration of an active QoS session.
        The overall duration of the QoS session, including the additional extended duration, shall not exceed the maximum duration limit fixed for the QoS Profile. If the current duration plus the value of `requestedAdditionalDuration` exceeds the maximum limit, the new overall duration shall be capped to the maximum value allowed.
        An example: For a QoS profile limited to a `maxDuration` of 50,000 seconds, a QoD session was originally created with duration 30,000 seconds. Before the session expires, the developer requests to extend the session by another 30,000 seconds:
        - Previous duration: 30,000 seconds
        - Requested additional duration: 30,000 seconds
        - New overall session duration: 50,000 seconds (the maximum allowed)

      summary: Get QoS session information for a device
      description: |
        Querying for QoS session resource information details for a device

        **NOTES:**
        - The access token may be either 2-legged or 3-legged.
          - If a 3-legged access token is used, the end user (and device) associated with the session must also be associated with the access token. In this case it is recommended NOT to include the `device` parameter in the request (see "Handling of device information" within the API description for details).
          - If a 2-legged access token is used, the device parameter must be provided and identify a device.
        - The session must have been created by the same API client given in the access token
        - If no QoS session is found for the requested device, an empty array is returned.

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.

          - address - an IPv4 number in dotted-quad form 1.2.3.4. Only this exact IP number will match the flow control rule.
          - address/mask - an IP number as above with a mask width of the form 1.2.3.4/24.
            In this case, all IP numbers from 1.2.3.0 to 1.2.3.255 will match. The bit width MUST be valid for the IP version.
