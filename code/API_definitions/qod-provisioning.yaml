  title: QoD Provisioning API
  description: |
    The Quality-On-Demand (QoD) Provisioning API offers a programmable interface for developers to request the assignment of a certain QoS Profile to a certain device, indefinitely.

    This API sets up the configuration in the network so the requested QoS profile is applied to an specified device, at any time while the provisioning is available. The device traffic will be treated with a certain QoS profile by the network whenever the device is connected to the network, until the provisioning is deleted.


    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **QoS profiles and QoS profile labels**:
    Latency, throughput or priority requirements of the application mapped to relevant QoS profile values. The set of QoS Profiles that a network operator is offering may be retrieved via the `qos-profiles` API (cf. https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/) or will be agreed during the onboarding with the API service provider.

    * **Identifier for the device**:
    At least one identifier for the device (user equipment) out of four options: IPv4 address, IPv6 address, Phone number, or Network Access Identifier assigned by the network operator for the device, at the request time. After the provisioning request is accepted, the device may get different IP addresses, but the provisioning will still apply to the device that was identified during the request process. Note: Network Access Identifier is defined for future use and will not be supported with v0.1 of the API.

    * **Notification URL and token**:
    Developers may provide a callback URL (`sink`) on which notifications about all status change events (eg. provisioning termination) can be received from the service provider. This is an optional parameter. The notification will be sent as a CloudEvent compliant message. If `sink` is included, it is RECOMMENDED for the client to provide as well the `sinkCredential` property to protect the notification endpoint. In the current version,`sinkCredential.credentialType` MUST be set to `ACCESSTOKEN` if provided.

    # Resources and Operations overview
    The API defines four operations:

    - An operation to setup a new QoD provisioning for a given device.
    - An operation to get the information about a specific QoD provisioning, identified by its `provisioningId`.
    - An operation to get the QoD provisioning for a given device.
    - An operation to terminate a QoD provisioning, identified by its `provisioningId`.

    # Authorization and Authentication

    [Camara Security and Interoperability Profile](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-Security-Interoperability.md) provides details on how a client requests an access token.

    Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco Operator exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access tokens becomes mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in strict compliance with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric data control.

    # Identifying a device from the access token

    This specification defines the `device` object field as optional in API requests, specifically in cases where the API is accessed using a 3-legged access token, and the device can be uniquely identified by the token. This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers by relying on the device information associated with the access token used to invoke the API.

    ## Handling of device information:

    ### Optional device object for 3-legged tokens:

    - When using a 3-legged access token, the device associated with the access token must be considered as the device for the API request. This means that the device object is not required in the request, and if included it must identify the same device, therefore **it is recommended NOT to include it in these scenarios** to simplify the API usage and avoid additional validations.

    ### Validation mechanism:

    - The server will extract the device identification from the access token, if available.
    - If the API request additionally includes a `device` object when using a 3-legged access token, the API will validate that the device identifier provided matches the one associated with the access token.
    - If there is a mismatch, the API will respond with a 403 - INVALID_TOKEN_CONTEXT error, indicating that the device information in the request does not match the token.

    ### Error handling for unidentifiable devices:

    - If the `device` object is not included in the request and the device information cannot be derived from the 3-legged access token, the server will return a 422 `UNIDENTIFIABLE_DEVICE` error.

    ### Restrictions for tokens without an associated authenticated identifier:

    - For scenarios which do not have a single device identifier associated to the token during the authentication flow, e.g. 2-legged access tokens, the `device` object MUST be provided in the API request. This ensures that the device identification is explicit and valid for each API call made with these tokens.

      summary: Sets a new provisioning of QoS for a device
      description: |
        Triggers a new provisioning in the operator to assign certain QoS Profile to certain device.

        - If the provisioning is completed synchronously, the response will be 201 with `status` = `AVAILABLE`.
        - If the provisioning request is accepted but not yet completed, the response will be 201 with `status` = `REQUESTED`.
        - If the operator determines synchronously that the provisioning request cannot be fulfilled, the response will be 201 with `status` = `UNAVAILABLE`.

        - If the request includes  the `sink` and `sinkCredential` properties, the client will receive a `status-changed` event with the outcome of the process. The event will be sent also for synchronous operations.

        **NOTES:**
        - When the provisioning status becomes `UNAVAILABLE`, the QoD provisioning resource is not immediately released, but will get deleted automatically, at earliest 360 seconds after.

        This behavior allows clients which are not receiving notification events but are polling, to get the provisioning status information. Before a client can attempt to create a new QoD provisioning for the same device, they must release the provisioning resources with an explicit `delete` operation if not yet automatically deleted.
        - The access token may be either 2-legged or 3-legged.
          - If a 3-legged access token which is associated with a device is used, it is recommended NOT to include the `device` parameter in the request (see "Handling of device information" within the API description for details).
          - If a 2-legged access token is used, the device parameter must be provided and identify a device.

        NOTE1: the network operator might support only a subset of these options. The API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across different network operators. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the same device.
        NOTE2: for the Commonalities release v0.4, we are enforcing that the networkAccessIdentifier is only part of the schema for future-proofing, and CAMARA does not currently allow its use. After the CAMARA meta-release work is concluded and the relevant issues are resolved, its use will need to be explicitly documented in the guidelines.

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
