                This is the target minimum upstream rate for the QoS profile.

                For 5G networks 3GPP Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) refers to a dedicated, fixed data rate assigned to
                specific services, ensuring a minimum performance level. As per 3GPP TS 23.203,
                GBR is a QoS parameter used to manage traffic classes in mobile networks. It
                provides a stable data rate for latency-sensitive applications, such as voice calls or
                video streaming, helping maintain a consistent user experience. When this attribute is set
                this could imply that a GBR QCI is used, though mechanisms on the network can be used to
                ensure a minimum performance level without using a GBR QCI.

                The committed data rate allocated to specific services, ensuring a consistent level of
                performance. For DOCSIS networks, the "Minimum Reserved Traffic Rate" is defined in the 
                DOCSIS 3.1 - MAC and Upper Layer Protocols Interface Specification" 
                and it ensures a consistent level of performance for specific services within the network.

                This is the target minimum downstream rate for the QoS profile.

                For 5G networks 3GPP Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) refers to a dedicated, fixed data rate assigned to
                specific services, ensuring a minimum performance level. As per 3GPP TS 23.203,
                GBR is a QoS parameter used to manage traffic classes in mobile networks. It
                provides a stable data rate for latency-sensitive applications, such as voice calls or
                video streaming, helping maintain a consistent user experience.  When this attribute is set
                this could imply that a GBR QCI is used, though mechanisms on the network can be used to
                ensure a minimum performance level without using a GBR QCI.

                The committed data rate allocated to specific services, ensuring a consistent level of
                performance. DOCSIS networks, the "Minimum Reserved Traffic Rate" is defined in the 
                DOCSIS 3.1 - MAC and Upper Layer Protocols Interface Specification" 
                and it ensures a consistent level of performance for specific services within the network.

                When defined, this is the maximum downstream burst rate for the QoS profile, that will enable
                the network to burst data at a higher rate than the maxDownstreamRate for a period of time.

                This can result in improved user experience when there is additional network capacity.
                For instance, when a user is streaming a video, the network can burst data at a higher rate
                to fill the buffer, and then return to the maxUpstreamRate once the buffer is full.

            Priority levels allow efficient resource allocation and ensure optimal performance
            for various services in each technology, with the highest priority traffic receiving
            preferential treatment.
            The lower value the higher priority.
            Not all access networks use the same priority range, so this priority will be
            scaled to the access network's priority range.

                The packet delay budget is the maximum allowable one-way latency between the customer's device
                and the gateway from the operator's network to other networks. By limiting the delay, the network
                can provide an acceptable level of performance for various services, such as voice calls,
                video streaming, and data.

                The end-to-end or round trip latency will be about two times this value plus the latency not controlled
                by the operator

            - description: |
                The jitter requirement aims to limit the maximum variation in round-trip
                packet delay for the 99th percentile of traffic, following ITU Y.1540
                standards. It considers only acknowledged packets in a session, which are
                packets that receive a confirmation of receipt from the recipient (e.g.,
                using TCP). This requirement helps maintain consistent latency, essential
                for real-time applications such as VoIP, video calls, and gaming.

            For 5G network the 3GPP specification TS 23.203 defines the packet error loss rate QCI attribute. It
            describes the Quality of Service (QoS) Class Identifier (QCI) parameters used to
            differentiate traffic classes in mobile networks, ensuring appropriate resource
            allocation and performance for various services.

            The packet error loss rate is one of the QCI attributes, providing information on the
            acceptable packet loss rate for a specific traffic class. This attribute helps maintain
            the desired performance level for services like voice calls, video streaming, or data
            transfers within the 3GPP mobile network.
