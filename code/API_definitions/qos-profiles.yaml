  title: QoS Profiles
  description: |
    The QoS Profiles API allows the discovery of Quality of Service (QoS) profiles and its characteristics.

    # Introduction

    QoS Profiles are used in conjunction with other Quality-On-Demand APIs, to offer the application developers the capability to request for stable latency (reduced jitter) or throughput for some specified application data flows between application clients (within a user device) and Application Servers (backend services). The developer has a pre-defined set of Quality of Service (QoS) profiles which they could choose from depending on their latency or throughput requirements. The QoS profiles are defined by the network operator and are mapped to the connectivity characteristics of the network.

    # API functionality

    The QoS Profiles API provides the following functionality:
    - Discovery of all QoS profiles offered by the network operator
    - Retrieve the characteristics of a specific QoS profile by name

    How QoS profiles are mapped to connectivity characteristics are subject to agreements between the communication service provider and the API invoker. Within the CAMARA project, you can find a sample for such a mapping of QoS profiles. [CAMARA QoS Profiles Mapping Table (REFERENCE DRAFT)](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/documentation/API_documentation/QoSProfile_Mapping_Table.md)

    # Authorization and Authentication

    [Camara Security and Interoperability Profile](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-Security-Interoperability.md) provides details on how a client requests an access token.

    Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco Operator exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access tokens becomes mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in strict compliance with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric data control.

    # Identifying a device from the access token

    This specification defines the `device` object field as optional in API requests, specifically in cases where the API is accessed using a 3-legged access token, and the device can be uniquely identified by the token. This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers by relying on the device information associated with the access token used to invoke the API.

    ## Handling of device information:

    ### Optional device object for 3-legged tokens:

    - When using a 3-legged access token, the device associated with the access token must be considered as the device for the API request. This means that the device object is not required in the request, and if included it must identify the same device, therefore **it is recommended NOT to include it in these scenarios** to simplify the API usage and avoid additional validations.

    ### Validation mechanism:

    - The server will extract the device identification from the access token, if available.
    - If the API request additionally includes a `device` object when using a 3-legged access token, the API will validate that the device identifier provided matches the one associated with the access token.
    - If there is a mismatch, the API will respond with a 403 - INVALID_TOKEN_CONTEXT error, indicating that the device information in the request does not match the token.

    ### Error handling for unidentifiable devices:

    - If the `device` object is not included in the request and the device information cannot be derived from the 3-legged access token, the server will return a 422 `UNIDENTIFIABLE_DEVICE` error.

    ### Restrictions for tokens without an associated authenticated identifier:

    - For scenarios which do not have a single device identifier associated to the token during the authentication flow, e.g. 2-legged access tokens, the `device` object MUST be provided in the API request. This ensures that the device identification is explicit and valid for each API call made with these tokens.

            packets that receive a confirmation of receipt from the recipient (e.g.,
            using TCP). This requirement helps maintain consistent latency, essential
            for real-time applications such as VoIP, video calls, and gaming.

            For 5G network the 3GPP specification TS 23.203 defines the packet error loss rate QCI attribute. It

            differentiate traffic classes in mobile networks, ensuring appropriate resource
            allocation and performance for various services.

            The packet error loss rate is one of the QCI attributes, providing information on the
            acceptable packet loss rate for a specific traffic class. This attribute helps maintain

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
