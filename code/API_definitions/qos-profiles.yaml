  title: QoS Profiles
  description: |
    The Quality-of-Service (QoS) Profiles API provides a set of predefined network performance characteristics, such as latency, throughput, and priority, identified by a unique name. These profiles allow application developers to specify the desired network behavior for their application's data traffic, ensuring optimal performance. By selecting an appropriate QoS profile, developers can request stable latency (reduced jitter) or throughput for specific data flows between client devices and application servers when used by the Quality-On-Demand APIs.

    # Introduction

    QoS Profiles are used in conjunction with other Quality-On-Demand APIs, to offer the API consumer the capability to request for stable latency (reduced jitter) or throughput for some specified application data flows between application clients (within a user device) and Application Servers (backend services). The API consumer has a pre-defined set of Quality of Service (QoS) profiles which they could choose from depending on their latency or throughput requirements. The QoS profiles are defined by the API provider and are mapped to the connectivity characteristics of the supported networks.

    # API functionality

    The QoS Profiles API provides the following functionality:
    - Discover all QoS profiles offered by the API provider
    - Discover the available QoS profiles for a specific device
    - Retrieve the characteristics of a specific QoS profile by name

    How QoS profiles are mapped to connectivity characteristics are subject to agreements between the API provider and the API consumer. Within the CAMARA project, you can find a sample for such a mapping of QoS profiles. [CAMARA QoS Profiles Mapping Table (REFERENCE DRAFT)](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/r3.2/documentation/API_documentation/QoSProfile_Mapping_Table.md)

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    # Identifying the device from the access token

    The two operations defined by this API (`getQosProfile` and `retrieveQoSProfiles`) both allow the API consumer to use a three-legged access token to specify a target device as a query filter. When provided, only profiles available to the specified target device will be returned. Additionally, when a two-legged access token is used, the operation `retrieveQoSProfiles` allows the API consumer to optionally specify the target device in the request body.

    Hence, for the `retrieveQoSProfiles` operation:
    - When invoked using a two-legged access token, the optional input device object will be used as filter if present.

    - When invoked using a three-legged access token, this optional identifier in the request body MUST NOT be provided, as the device to filter will be uniquely identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the access token and was identified during the authentication process.

    ## Error handling:
    - If the device can be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is also included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This will be the case even if the same device is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.

    # Multi-SIM scenario handling

    In multi-SIM scenarios where more than one mobile device is associated with a phone number (e.g. a smartphone with an associated smartwatch), it might not be possible to uniquely identify a single device from that phone number. When filtering QoS profiles by device in such scenarios, one of the following options should be used:
    - Use the authorisation code flow to obtain a 3-legged access token, which will automatically identify the intended device
    - Identify the intended device from a unique identifier for that device, such as its source IP address and port
    - Check with the SIM provider whether a unique "secondary" phone number is already associated with each device, and use the secondary phone number to identify the intended device if available

    # Additional CAMARA error responses

    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive. Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses. The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.

        **NOTES:**
        - The access token may be either a 2-legged or 3-legged access token.
        - If the access token is 3-legged, all returned QoS Profiles will be available to the subject (device) associated with the access token.
        - If the access token is 2-legged and a device filter is provided, all returned QoS Profiles will be available to that device. If multiple device identifiers are provided within the device property, only QoS Profiles available to the device identifier chosen by the implementation will be returned, even if the identifiers do not match the same device. API provider does not perform any logic to validate/correlate that the indicated device identifiers match the same device. No error should be returned if the identifiers are otherwise valid to prevent API consumers correlating different identifiers with a given end user.
        - This call uses the POST method instead of GET to comply with the CAMARA Commonalities guidelines for sending sensitive or complex data in API calls. Since the device field may contain personally identifiable information, it should not be sent via GET. Additionally, this call may include complex data structures.

            - When there is no device filter, availability for a given country means that the QoS profile may be available to some devices connected to the listed networks in that country (or to the API provider’s default network if none are listed). However, this does not imply that the profile is available to all devices, or that a particular device will be able to use the profile across all listed countries or networks. In particular, the response does not provide enough information to determine availability for roaming for specific devices; consumers should query the API with a specific device identifier to get definitive availability.
            - If this field is not present in the QoS profile, no assumption can be made about the availability of the profile in any given country or for any given network

            Specifies the type of queue for L4S (Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput) traffic management. L4S is an advanced queue management approach designed to provide ultra-low latency and high throughput for internet traffic, particularly beneficial for interactive applications such as gaming, video conferencing, and virtual reality.

            **Queue Type Descriptions:**

            - **non-l4s-queue**:
              A traditional queue used for legacy internet traffic that does not utilize L4S enhancements. It provides standard latency and throughput levels.

            - **l4s-queue**:
              A dedicated queue optimized for L4S traffic, delivering ultra-low latency, low loss, and scalable throughput to support latency-sensitive applications.

            - **mixed-queue**:
              A shared queue that can handle both L4S and traditional traffic, offering a balance between ultra-low latency for L4S flows and compatibility with non-L4S flows.

            The name of a Service Class, representing a QoS Profile designed to provide optimized behavior for a specific application type. While DSCP values are commonly associated with Service Classes, their use may vary across network segments and may not be applied throughout the entire end-to-end QoS session. This aligns with the serviceClass concept used in HomeDevicesQoQ for consistent terminology.

            Service classes define specific QoS behaviors that map to DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) values or Microsoft QoS traffic types.

            The supported mappings are:
            1. Values aligned with the [RFC4594](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4594) guidelines for differentiated traffic classes.

    Device:
      description: |
        End-user equipment able to connect to a mobile network. Examples of devices include smartphones or IoT sensors/actuators.

        The developer can choose to provide the below specified device identifiers:

        * `ipv4Address`
        * `ipv6Address`
        * `phoneNumber`
        NOTE1: the network operator might support only a subset of these options. The API consumer can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across different operators. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the same device.
        NOTE2: as for this Commonalities release, we are enforcing that the networkAccessIdentifier is only part of the schema for future-proofing, and CAMARA does not currently allow its use. After the CAMARA meta-release work is concluded and the relevant issues are resolved, its use will need to be explicitly documented in the guidelines.

In 3GPP terminology, it corresponds to the GPSI formatted with the External Identifier ({Local Identifier}@{Domain Identifier}). Unlike the telephone number, the network access identifier is not subjected to portability ruling in force, and is individually managed by each operator.
      type: string
      example: "123456789@domain.com"

    PhoneNumber:
      description: A public identifier addressing a telephone subscription. In mobile networks it corresponds to the MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number).

    DeviceIpv4Addr:
      type: object
      description: |
        The device should be identified by either the public (observed) IP address and port as seen by the application server, or the private (local) and any public (observed) IP addresses in use by the device (this information can be obtained by various means, for example from some DNS servers).

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
