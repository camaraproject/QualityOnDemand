|  |  | \- API version 1\.2\.0 specs are available at: [https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/tree/main/code/API\_definitions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/tree/main/code/API_definitions)<br>\- Reviews from WG members discussed and worked on using open issues:<br>[https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues) <br>\- topics started to be addressed within relevant GitHub issues \- thank you\! |
| **CURRENT ISSUES** |  | **Total: 11 [ Open: 6 , Closed: 5 ]** |
| Issue QoD#1<br>*Create a mapping table for qos\_profiles* | TEF/DT | A reference draft has for discussion been published to:<br>[https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/code/API\_definitions/QoSProfile\_Mapping\_Table.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/code/API_definitions/QoSProfile_Mapping_Table.md)<br>\* <span class="s1">**Note**: This table is only an example that can be used within Camara for validating the QoD APIs</span><br>\* change L to "up to unlimited" or rather "best effort" (Vodafone proposal), see [GitHub comment](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/1)<br>\* DT agrees with Vodafone comments and notes that it this mapping table is just an example that could be used for validations within the alliance. <br>\* Orange: Maintaining a separate YAML for every new profile is not manageable and this could instead be delegated to the discovery service as specified in issue #7<br>\* DT:  The discovery API is in our backlog and once implemented, the separate YAML constructs wont be needed anymore.<br>\* ToDO: please verify and comment through the GitHub ISSUE your position on such mapping<br>**Status : Open/Active discussion**  <br>**Proposed action: Close** |
| Issue QoD#2<br>*Document relevant notifications for QoD APIs* | All | A placeholder for the list of notifications (e.g. *session\_termination* notification) relevant for the QoD API family has been created:<br>[https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/code/API\_definitions/Notifications.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/code/API_definitions/Notifications.md)<br>\* currently only *session\_termination* notification is present<br>**Status : Open/Active**<br>**Proposed action : Closed (Comment: Issue closed with Living document only)** |
| Issue QoD#12<br>*Create user stories for QoD in line with Commonalities standard* | DT | - As agreed previously in issue #3, please use the Commonalities User Story Template that has been just finalized to align the QoD User Stories with the Camara common template.<br>\* Contribute user stories based on template<br>\* *DT is working internally (DOC internal review)*<br>**Status : Open/Active** |
| **NEW Topic** |  |  |
| Issue #11<br><span class="js-issue-title markdown-title" style="box-sizing: border-box;">*\- Is enum the best choice for qos\_profile*</span> | Orange | -What if a client needs a QoS profile with LOW\_LATENCY and THROUGHPUT\_L?<br>-We would need to add an enum key that represents this combination and also a new key for all other relevant ones.<br>-We could associate each profile with values based on the power of two (1, 2, 4, 8, 16...) and compose them via an OR operation. <br>*DT comment:*<br>-CAMARA goal is to define some general approach -> production deployments will differ <br>-Discovery profile API might be solution to get list of QOS Profile "flavours"<br>-Simmilar approach applied by Public cloud vendors (Instance flavours for many use-cases)<br>-Will depend on Operator and Technology (e.g. GSMA based blueprint possible)<br>**Status: Open/Discussion started**<br>**Proposed action: Close (?) or just propose more details regarding the requirement** |
| **QoD Backlog** |  |  |
| Issue #7<br>*\- Add new endpoint in QoD API to request available qos\_profiles\(Discovery API\)* | DT | Issue #7 (*enhancement*) labeled as QoD-backlog due to other on-going priorities<br>\- the operation is going to be performed through discovery<br>\- could be an additional way of addressing issue \#1 \(see Vodafone's [comment](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/1))<br>\* DT will check internaly with DEV team |
| Issue #8<br>*-Impact of verification for authorised recipient (e.g. UE) on API spec* | All | Issue #8 outcome can impact the QoD API (e.g. GPSI id vs IP identification).<br>This may be also loosely related to Commonalities Authentication & Authorization standards and [Commonalities issue #4](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/4):<br>the [proposal](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/Commonalities/documentation/Deliverables/UE%20identifiers.pptx) to identify UEs primarily with GPSI (in any existing format either MSISDN or ext identifier) and optionally with UE IP or MAC.<br>\* the auth by GPSI is initially accepted by the workgroup - still, <i>**the impact on API def is to be analyzed**</i><br>\* technical discussion on-going (include Commonalities) : Security and Auth will not be part of API<br>\* E/// proposed to close<br>**Status: Open/Active discussion**<br>**Proposed action: Continue effort (define user stories and design)** <br>   **->Organize global meeting to discuss within broader audience (@M.K)** |
