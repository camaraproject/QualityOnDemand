| *CLOSED ISSUES* |  |  |
| Issue #19: **closed**<br>\- Add possibility to specify duration in the QoD APIs | DT | [Issue #19](https://github.com/camaraproject/rep\_main/issues/19) has been addressed:<br>\- version 1\.2\.0 of the API definitions uploaded to *QualityOnDemand* subdirectory.<br>The new version implements the duration parameter of *CreateSession* component schema and a *SESSION\_TERMINATED* event when the session ends/expires.<br>\- The duration property is not going to be a mandatory parameter and is defined as follows:<br>*`(...)`*<br>`duration:`<br>`  type: integer`<br>`  example: 86400`<br>`  description: `<br>`____Session duration in seconds. Maximal value of 24 hours is used if not set.`<br>`____After session has expired the client will receive SESSION_TERMINATED event. See`<br>`____notification callback.`<br>`  format: int32`<br>`  minimum: 1`<br>`  maximum: 86400`<br>*`(...)`* |
| Issue #16 **closed**<br>Questions on QoD user stories | E/// | \- comment from TEF under the GitHub issue: We should follow user story template discussed in Commonalities WG for every selected use case\.<br>\- Issue has been closed \- to be re\-opened upon completion of Commonalities User Stories template |
| Issue #18 **closed**<br>Subactivity to create table to map ‘Throughput\_S/M/L’ and ‘LOW\_LATENCY’ and standard 3GPP QCI/5QI values. | Telefónica | \- questions 1&2 addressed in December\.<br>\- Question 3: table mapping activity created as issue \#21 in order to close this issue\. |
|  |  |  |
| *CURRENT ISSUES* |  |  |
| Issue #21<br>Create a mapping table for qos\_profiles | TEF/DT? | The draft placeholder is located under: [https://github.com/camaraproject/rep\_main/blob/main/APIs/QualityOnDemand/QoSProfile\_Mapping\_Table.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/rep\_main/blob/main/APIs/QualityOnDemand/QoSProfile\_Mapping\_Table.md)<br>\* DT: There are multiple values of QCI/5QI to be mapped: configuration blueprint to be done by API vendor<br>\* TangibleXR: a possible workaround is API Discovery; the parameter options would be explained in API and translated into proper values. Defining normative values may not be in scope of Camara (but rather reserved for each business/CSP on their own)<br>\* TEF: then a problem arises with consistency and providing quality of UX. There are plenty of options, but to ensure consistent testing, we need a ref. value from each tag.<br>\* We agree to create an initial blueprint draft, possibly created by TEF (and DT co-operation) to put this discussion further and see if we can create a commonly accepted document |
| Issue #22<br>Document relevant notifications for QoD APIs | All | A placeholder for the list of notifications (e.g. *session\_termination* notification) relevant for the QoD API family has been created: [https://github.com/camaraproject/rep\_main/blob/main/APIs/QualityOnDemand/Notifications.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/rep\_main/blob/main/APIs/QualityOnDemand/Notifications.md) <br>\* currently only *session\_termination* notification is present<br>\* please document which other notification may be relevant for the Service API |
|  |  |  |
| *QOD-BACKLOG* |  |  |
| Issue #15 <br>Consider additional specs: more network API specifications which have QoS support beyond the well-known NEF APIs | E/// | \* to be closed following contribution by E/// to Camara - being investigated by Commonalities group<br>\* update coming in GitHub next week before the Camara Commonalities group meeting so it can be discussed then |
| Issue #20: *enhancement*<br>\- Add new endpoint in QoD API to request available qos\_profiles | DT | Issue #20 will be labeled as QoD-backlog due to other on-going priorities<br>\- the operation is going to be performed through discovery |
| Issue #34<br>impact of verification for authorised recipient (e.g. UE) on API spec | E/// | issue #36 outcome can impact the QoD API (e.g. GPSI id vs IP identification). Using NEF could be possible to have a translation - to be addressed in #36. |
