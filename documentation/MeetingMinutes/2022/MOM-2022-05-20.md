| ----------- | --- | --- |
| **Welcome & Recap** |  |  |
|  |  | <span class="s1">Repository&nbsp;&nbsp;address:<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>[https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand)</span> |
|  |  | \- API version 1\.2\.0 specs are available at: [https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/tree/main/code/API\_definitions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/tree/main/code/API_definitions)<br>\- Reviews from WG members discussed and worked on using open issues:<br>[https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues) <br>\- topics started to be addressed within relevant GitHub issues \- thank you\! |
| **CURRENT ISSUES** |  | **Total: 11 [ Open: 2 , Closed: 9 ]** |
| Issue QoD#12<br>*\- Create user stories for QoD in line with Commonalities standard* | DT | - As agreed previously in issue #3, please use the Commonalities User Story Template that has been just finalized to align the QoD User Stories with the Camara common template.<br>\* Contribute user stories based on template<br><br>**Status : Open/Active development <i>*(under-review)*</i>**   <br> **- UPDATE : User story and Latency/Bandwidth API-docs under internal review** |
| Issue #7<br>*\- Add new endpoint in QoD API to request available qos\_profiles\(Discovery API\)* | DT | Issue #7 (*enhancement*) labeled as QoD-backlog due to other on-going priorities<br>\- the operation is going to be performed through discovery<br>\- could be an additional way of addressing issue \#1 \(see Vodafone's [comment](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/1))<br><br>**Status : On-Hold**<br>**\* Activity started and "internal" proposal being discussed**<br> <i>**\- UPDATE : Discussed use cases \(e\.g\. Network Slice\) include feedback from Hyprescalers \- under consideration**</i> |
| **NEW ISSUES** |  |  |
| Testing and Validation | DT,<br>Orange | \* We need to start to summary leassons learnt from Dev/Validate   <br>\* Priorities on validation, make some progress <br>  -> test cases definition for BW/Latency management  <br>\* DT internal solution (**TBC**)  <br>   - QoS profiles: what is the requirement  <br>   - On-demand resource reservation and numbers for UL/DL flows<br>   - Testing requirements would be easier to define and understand <br>   - Example: Video/Control function based on the solution definition. <br>   **UPDATE (DT/BMW/Valeo AVP):** <br>    [https://www.telekom.com/en/media/media-information/archive/automated-valet-parking-with-5g-648970](https://www.telekom.com/en/media/media-information/archive/automated-valet-parking-with-5g-648970)<br>    - The data packets are transferred with always the same delay even under high load conditions (stable low latency) or           the bandwidth is kept on the same level even under high load (stable bandwidth).<br>    - During the time of the car maneuvering the data connection is prioritized against other data connections in the same         mobile cell.<br>    <br><b>*\* Example sequence diagram is requested with call flows     (Terminal -> <b>*AF ->*</b> CAMARA API (Exposure GW) -> SeNF\* -> NEF/SCEF interaction )*</b>     SeNF - Service Enabling Network Function <br>***\* Sample application to be considered***<br>    <br>\* Orange : conditions in which API is called<br>   -  Activity on-going and what to expose will be discused and decided in Orange |
| Transform Function | TEF | **Goal : Service API will deliver consistent funcionality for End-users**<br>\* Metrics names and target goals <br>\* How to include into Transform Function <br>\* Testing workflow defined and included: CAMARA API / Transform / NEF <br><br>**Transform Function**       <br>\* 3GPP VS CAMARA: AN OPENAPI COMPARISON presented by TEF <br>*\- Focus on 3GPP <i>*& CAMARA*</i> API with Mappping Table presented (PPT will be distributed)* |
| **QoD & API Backlogs** |  |  |
| Issue #8<br>*-Impact of verification for authorised recipient (e.g. UE) on API spec* | All | Issue #8 outcome can impact the QoD API (e.g. GPSI id vs IP identification).<br>This may be also loosely related to Commonalities Authentication & Authorization standards and [Commonalities issue #4](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/4)<br>**Status: Closed** |
| API Backlog : <br><br>Issue <span class="js-issue-title markdown-title" style="box-sizing: border-box;">#29</span><br>- <span class="js-issue-title markdown-title" style="box-sizing: border-box;">API to Request the Status of the Network Traffic &nbsp;</span> |  | **Use Case: Adapting Video Encoding to the Network Conditions**<br>When processing data from a video camera the bandwidth required is highly dependent on the encoding settings within the camera. The bandwidth can be controlled by either changing the resolution of the video or the encoding quality. <br>\* Trade off between video quality and delay. If the delay reaches a threshold it is more desirable to reduce video quality than to have the highest possible video quality. It is desirable to reduce the video quality if it reduces the network delay for the video delivery.<br>\* Monitor API which provides an indication of the status of the network (delay and traffic levels and other parameters that would indicate the performance of the network).<br>\* Based on the status,the Application adjusts the encoding level to best suite the condition in network. <br><br>**Status: Open / Discussed** <br>\* QoD related topic are discussed <br> - Monitor API and Manage the "parameters" <br> - QoD members are encouraged to partcipate in the discussion<br> - Let's discuss on the next meeting |
| **AOB** |  |  |
|  |  | 1\. GSMA OPG/OPAG Meetings \[24\-25\.05\] <br>  \* Encouraged F2F Internal meetings to discuss issues & ideas        <br>2\. Next QoD meeting in two weeks on the 3rd of June |
