| **CURRENT ISSUES** |  |  |
| Issue #21 -> QoD#1<br>Create a mapping table for qos\_profiles | TEF/DT/<br>/All? | The draft placeholder has been relocated to:<br>[https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/code/API\_definitions/QoSProfile\_Mapping\_Table.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/code/API_definitions/QoSProfile_Mapping_Table.md)<br>\* Multiple values of QCI/5QI to be mapped, possibly via a configuration blueprint<br><br>\* TEF: 5QI initial investigation by TEF leads to suggest to limit the throughput to two values: standard and premium for validation purposes. At least as internal reference validation for Camara.<br>\* standard NEST for eMBB slice -> 3GPP 5QI: 1,2,5,6,7,8,9<br><br>\* Orange: Maybe a range of values possible for operators to choose could be possible.<br>\* DT: could we leave this to operators, so they can customize their offering (as, e.g., cloud operators do).<br>\* Intel: we need to guarantee consistency towards developers by offering at least similar values.<br><br>\* TODO actions:<br>\- please reflect your proposals/comments under [GitHub issue #1](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/1)<br>\- check internally with teams what has been tested/proposed |
| Issue #22 -> QoD#2<br>Document relevant notifications for QoD APIs | All | A placeholder for the list of notifications (e.g. *session\_termination* notification) relevant for the QoD API family has been created:<br>[https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/code/API\_definitions/Notifications.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/code/API_definitions/Notifications.md)<br>\* currently only *session\_termination* notification is present<br><br>\* E///: add QoS monitoring event notifications from NEF - it may be a candidate for future notification<br>\* DT: we were not able to validate other notifications internally until now<br>\* Orange: specific feedback on QoS event, tested in Orange, to be discussed internally if other notifications are relevant<br><br>\* TODO: please document through the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/2) if other notification may be relevant for the Service API |
|  |  |  |
| *QOD-BACKLOG* |  |  |
| Issue #15 -> #6<br>Consider more network API specifications | E/// | Issue #6 - consider more network API specifications which have QoS support beyond the well-known NEF APIs<br>\* c<span class="s1">onsider EES/SEAL also within CAMARA scope, but maybe as medium-term objective in the backlog.</span> |
| Issue #20 -> #7<br>\- Add new endpoint in QoD API to request available qos\_profiles | DT | Issue #7 (*enhancement*) will be labeled as QoD-backlog due to other on-going priorities<br>\- the operation is going to be performed through discovery |
| Issue #34 -> #8<br>impact of verification for authorised recipient (e.g. UE) on API spec | E/// | Issue #8 outcome can impact the QoD API (e.g. GPSI id vs IP identification).<br>This may be also loosely related to Commonalities Authentication & Authorization standards and [Commonalities issue #4](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/4): <span class="s1">the&nbsp;</span>[proposal](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/Commonalities/documentation/Deliverables/UE%20identifiers.pptx)<span class="s1">&nbsp;to identify UEs primarily with GPSI (in any existing format either MSISDN or ext identifier) and optionally with UE IP or MAC.</span> |
| Issue #16 / #3 *closed*<br>Update of QoD user stories | E/// | \- We should follow user story template discussed in Commonalities WG for every selected use case\.<br>\- Issue has been closed \- QoD user stories will be updated upon completion of Commonalities User Stories template\. |
