| Issue QoD#7<br>*\- Add new endpoint in QoD API to request available qos\_profiles\(Discovery API\)* | DT | Issue #7 (*enhancement*) labeled as QoD-backlog due to other on-going priorities<br>\- the operation is going to be performed through discovery<br>\- could be an additional way of addressing issue \#1 \(see Vodafone's [comment](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/1))<br><br>**Status : On-Hold (No-Change)** |
| **NEW ISSUES / Discuss point** |  |  |
| Testing and Validation | DT,<br>Orange | **GOAL: We need to start to summarize leassons learnt from Dev/Validate**   <br>\* Priorities on validation, make some progress <br>  -> test cases definition for BW/Latency management  <br>\* DT solution developed with partners: AVP sample application presented<br>    [https://www.telekom.com/en/media/media-information/archive/automated-valet-parking-with-5g-648970](https://www.telekom.com/en/media/media-information/archive/automated-valet-parking-with-5g-648970)<br><b>&nbsp;*\- Following components discussed based on the AVP&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Terminal \-&gt; <b>*AF -&gt;*</b>&nbsp;CAMARA API (Exposure GW) -&gt; SeNF\* -&gt; NEF/SCEF interaction*</b> <br>     \* SeNF - Service Enabling Network Function <br>   AVP Use case with Camara QoD description:<br>   [https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/documentation/Contributions/CAMARA\_AVP\_Short\_Overview.pptx](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/documentation/Contributions/CAMARA_AVP_Short_Overview.pptx)<br>   <br>   -> M.Jarzab & Morell will colaborate on further enhancements (UML , Call-flow / consider access technology 4G/5G NSA/SA)<br><br>\* Orange : conditions in which API is called<br> -  Activity on-going and what to expose will be discused and decided in Orange |
| Transform Function | TEF | **Goal : Service API will deliver consistent funcionality for End-users**<br>\* Metrics names and target goals <br>\* How to include into Transform Function <br>\* Testing workflow defined and included: CAMARA API / Transform / NEF <br><br>**Transform Function**       <br>\* 3GPP VS CAMARA: AN OPENAPI COMPARISON presented by TEF <br>*\- Focus on 3GPP <i></i>& CAMARA\** API with Mappping Table presented (PPT will be distributed)<br>- <i>**On-going action proposed : How to design for SeNF integration (Transfomers/Adapters) or being part of Exposure Gateway / API Management**</i> <br> <i>**-&gt; Based on agreement during the community meeting, SeNF should contain Transform Function**</i> |
| **QoD & API Backlogs** |  |  |
| API Backlog : <br><br>Issue <span class="js-issue-title markdown-title" style="box-sizing: border-box;">#29</span><br>- <span class="js-issue-title markdown-title" style="box-sizing: border-box;">API to Request the Status of the Network Traffic &nbsp;</span> |  | **Use Case: Adapting Video Encoding to the Network Conditions**<br>When processing data from a video camera the bandwidth required is highly dependent on the encoding settings within the camera. The bandwidth can be controlled by either changing the resolution of the video or the encoding quality. <br>\* Trade off between video quality and delay. If the delay reaches a threshold it is more desirable to reduce video quality than to have the highest possible video quality. It is desirable to reduce the video quality if it reduces the network delay for the video delivery.<br>\* Monitor API which provides an indication of the status of the network (delay and traffic levels and other parameters that would indicate the performance of the network).<br>\* Based on the status,the Application adjusts the encoding level to best suite the condition in network. <br>[https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/29](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/29)<br><br>**Status: Open / Discussed** <br>\* QoD related topic are discussed <br> - Monitor API and Manage the "parameters" <br> - QoD members are encouraged to partcipate in the discussion<br> <br>**-> Andrew will preapre material to be presented on the API Backlog** |
