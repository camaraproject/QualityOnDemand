| **Welcome & Recap** |  |  |
|  |  | <span class="s1">Repository&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;address:<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>[https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand)</span> |
|  |  | \- API version 1\.2\.0 specs are available at: [https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/tree/main/code/API\_definitions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/tree/main/code/API_definitions)<br>\- Reviews from WG members discussed and worked on using open issues:<br>[https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues) <br>\- topics started to be addressed within relevant GitHub issues \- thank you\! |
|  |  |  |
| **CURRENT ISSUES** |  |  |
| Issue QoD#1<br>Create a mapping table for qos\_profiles | TEF/DT | A reference draft has for discussion been published to:<br>[https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/code/API\_definitions/QoSProfile\_Mapping\_Table.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/code/API_definitions/QoSProfile_Mapping_Table.md)<br>\* <span class="s1">**Note**: This table is only an example that can be used within Camara for validating the QoD APIs</span><br>\* change L to "up to unlimited" or rather "best effort" (Vodafone proposal), see [GitHub comment](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/1)<br>\* DT agrees with Vodafone comments and notes that it this mapping table is just an example that could be used for validations within the alliance. <br>\* Orange: Maintaining a separate YAML for every new profile is not manageable and this could instead be delegated to the discovery service as specified in issue #7<br>\* DT:  The discovery API is in our backlog and once implemented, the separate YAML constructs wont be needed anymore.<br>\* ToDO: please verify and comment through the GitHub ISSUE your position on such mapping |
| Issue QoD#2<br>Document relevant notifications for QoD APIs | All | A placeholder for the list of notifications (e.g. *session\_termination* notification) relevant for the QoD API family has been created:<br>[https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/code/API\_definitions/Notifications.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/code/API_definitions/Notifications.md)<br>\* currently only *session\_termination* notification is present |
| Issue QoD#9<br>security requirements bug | DT | \* corrected security requirements mistake/"typo" (referring to *APIKeys* instead of *oAuth2ClientCredentials*) with PR#10<br>\* Orange is working on a possible real-life implementation. Lab with E/// SCEF, checking both radio access types.<br>\* DT: working as well on NEF.<br>-> We could validate it in both cases, hoping to validate it additionally with a NEF emulator.<br>\* Intel prepared a NEF emulator, investigating internally on its capabilities ([Commonalities issue #26](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/26)). |
| NEW TOPIC | Orange | \* Orange Q: If an API such as the one used for QoD could be applied for both 4G/5G, what should be the validation process? <br>DT-> This question  could be valid for more than just the QoD API and a new issue in commonalities will be created to discuss the details.<br>ToDo: create issue in <span> </span>commonalities issue for verification of API 4G/5G capabilities<br><br>Orange: We wish to provide reference implementation of QoD APIs and validate it against SCEF. Would be interested in alignment with other partners on this. <br>DT: working on implementation as well and will validate against NEF. Another validation will be mostly don't against NEF emulator contributed to community (possibly from Intel) |
|  |  |  |
| *QOD-BACKLOG* |  |  |
| Issue QoD#3 Questions on QoD user stories | DT | \- comment from TEF under the GitHub issue: We should follow user story template discussed in Commonalities WG for every selected use case\.<br>\- Issue has been closed \- to be re\-opened upon completion of Commonalities User Stories template next week<br>ToDo:<br>\* Open new issue to contribute user stories based on template<br>\* Open another issue to contribute api documentation based on template |
| Issue #6<br>Consider additional specs: more network API specifications | E/// | Issue #6 - consider more network API specifications which have QoS support beyond the well-known NEF APIs<br>consider EES/SEAL also within CAMARA scope, but maybe as medium-term objective in the backlog.<br>\* DT: related to GPSI GH issue on Commonalities<br>\* E/// closed this issue, please see related [Commonalities issue #4](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/4) for further comments and discussion. |
| Issue #7<br>\- Add new endpoint in QoD API to request available qos\_profiles | DT | Issue #7 (*enhancement*) labeled as QoD-backlog due to other on-going priorities<br>\- the operation is going to be performed through discovery<br>\- could be an additional way of addressing issue \#1 \(see Vodafone's [comment](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/1)) |
| Issue #8<br>impact of verification for authorised recipient (e.g. UE) on API spec | All | Issue #8 outcome can impact the QoD API (e.g. GPSI id vs IP identification).<br>This may be also loosely related to Commonalities Authentication & Authorization standards and [Commonalities issue #4](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/4): the [proposal](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/Commonalities/documentation/Deliverables/UE%20identifiers.pptx) &nbsp; to identify UEs primarily with GPSI (in any existing format either MSISDN or ext identifier) and optionally with UE IP or MAC.<br>* the auth by GPSI is initially accepted by the workgroup - still, the impact on API def is to be analyzed<br>* thank you for comments in the issue |
