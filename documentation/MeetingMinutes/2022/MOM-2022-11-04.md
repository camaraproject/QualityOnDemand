## Discussion

| Agenda Item | Description | 
| ----------- | ------------|
| **Recap & Recent Updates** |  |
|  | <ul><li>Repo: [https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand)</li><li>Issues:&nbsp;[https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues)&nbsp;</li><li>Pull Requests: [https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pulls](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pulls)</li></ul> |
| **Housekeeping** |  |
|  | Mailinglist: Please subscribe if not yet done to the mailinglist of the subproject here: [https://lists.camaraproject.org/g/sp-qod](https://lists.camaraproject.org/g/sp-qod)<br>The list will be used for invitations and discussions between members of the sub project. The address is: sp-qod@lists.camaraproject.org |
|  | Team call: new Teams meeting link distributed within invitation and within README.md. Time changed to UTC 13:00, due to change to wintertime in EU
|  | Main branch is now protected, a merge requires at least one review by a codeowner. Codeowner will take care to involve current maintainers and invovled contributors in relevant pull request reviews.
|  | Branch dev-v0.9.0 created for changes which are targeted for the next version of the API definition. Use this branch as target for change requests of the current API yaml file.
| **Update of MAINTAINERS.MD** | |
|  | Jose A Ordonez Lucena resigned as maintainer and proposed Jose Luis Urien with Jesus Peña as standin as new maintainers within the subproject. Accepted without objections, change to MAINTAINERS.MD merged |
| **PR #62 - Improvement proposal for QoSProfile_Mapping_Table.md** | |
|  | Thorsten presented his pull request to improve the QoSProfile_Mapping_Table with the aim to make it more understandable for developers. Comments were discussed, the PR should be continued with updates based on the discussion. <ul><li>The example character has to be emphasized, it is too early to agree already on numers</li><li>Eric's comment can be partly addressed partly by using "statistically assured" instead of "assured" (to make clear that it isn't contractually assured)</li><li>Going forward a realization of issue #7 (Add new endpoint in QoD API to request available qos_profiles) should support QoS profile definitions together with KPIs |
