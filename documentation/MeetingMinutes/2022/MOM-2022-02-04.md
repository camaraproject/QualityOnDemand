## Agenda Proposal / Discussion items
Agenda Item |  Who| &nbsp;
---- |  -------- |  ----
Welcome & Recap |&nbsp; |-   Api specs are available at: <br/> [https://github.com/camaraproject/rep_main/tree/main/APIs/QualityOnDemand](https://github.com/camaraproject/rep_main/tree/main/APIs/QualityOnDemand) <br/><br/> -   Reviews from WG members discussed and worked on using open issues:      [https://github.com/camaraproject/rep_main/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AQoD](https://github.com/camaraproject/rep_main/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AQoD)  <br/><br/> -   E/// proposals in issue #33 have been split into 4 separate issues (#34 and #36-38): <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;   1.  Impact of verification for authorised recipient (e.g. UE) on QoD API spec (issue #34)  <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;    2.  GPSI as UE identifier under _general_ label so that wider audience get a say  <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;    3.  Terminology related issue merged with #24 in _commonalities_ group  <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;   4.  Authorisation related issue also under _commonalities  <br/><br/> -   topics started to be addressed within relevant GitHub issues - thanks!  
Issue #15  <br/>Consider additional specs: more network API specifications which have QoS support beyond the well-known NEF APIs| E/// |  <br/> -   E/// is working on new presentation to provide details for extension/changes proposed for issue #15 <br/>-   Proposal to make this a Camara medium-term objective by DT & TEF while waiting for EES/SEAL implementations. <br/> -   This issue is being marked as QoD-backlog = this is a new label for postponing issues as keeping as backlog
Issue #16<br/>Questions on QoD user stories | E///|-   new comments (TEF): We should follow user story template discussed in Commonalities WG for every selected use case. Otherwise, some of the details/implications of the user stories are not fully clear.<br/>-   Issue to be closed and re-opened upon completion of Commonalities User Stories template
Issue #18 <br/>Subactivity to create table to map ‘Throughput_S/M/L’ and ‘LOW_LATENCY’ and standard 3GPP QCI/5QI values. |Telefónica|-   questions 1&2 addressed in December.<br/>-   Question 3: table mapping activity created as issue #21<br/>-   to be closed as soon as #21 is developed
Issue #19 & #20 are _enhancements_ <br/>-   Add possibility to specify duration in the QoD APIs<br/>-   Add new endpoint in QoD API to request available qos_profiles| DT | Issue #19 is under development (DT):<br/>-  it is not going to be a mandatory feature<br/>-  An example of B2C "boost activation" use case could be gaming apps (a specific use case may be described in more detail during one of next meetings)<br/> -   Orange: monitoring of duration and consumption and complementary offer of QoS linked to specific area could be proposed as further enhancement<br/>- TEF: this feature will simplify the API consumer life so he does not have to remember to deactivate. But more background functions may be needed for the implementation, therefore implications of what is to be included (e.g. a duration timer) should be analyzed<br/><br/>Issue #20 will be labeled as QoD-backlog due to other on-going priorities<br/>- the operation is going to be performed through discovery
Issue #21 <br/>Create a mapping table for qos_profiles |All |Everyone is invited to contribute and add proposed rows to the table. The draft placeholder is located under: [https://github.com/camaraproject/rep_main/blob/main/APIs/QualityOnDemand/QoSProfile_Mapping_Table.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/rep_main/blob/main/APIs/QualityOnDemand/QoSProfile_Mapping_Table.md)
Issue #22<br/>Document relevant notifications for QoD APIs|All| A placeholder for the list of notifications (e.g. _session_termination_ notification) relevant for the QoD API family has been created: [https://github.com/camaraproject/rep_main/blob/main/APIs/QualityOnDemand/Notifications.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/rep_main/blob/main/APIs/QualityOnDemand/Notifications.md) <br/> Everyone is invited to contribute to the newly created table.
Issue #34<br/>impact of verification for authorised recipient (e.g. UE) on API spec | E/// | issue #36 outcome can impact the QoD API (e.g. GPSI id vs IP identification). Using NEF could be possible to have a translation - to be addressed in #36.
