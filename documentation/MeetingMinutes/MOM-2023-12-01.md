## Merged PRs & Release Candidate v0.10.0-rc

* The following PR were merged since the last meeting:
  * [#216 Extend session duration](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/216) after final review
  * [#224 Align event notification with CloudEvents spec](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/224) after final review
  * [#233 Alignment with changes in https://github.com/camaraproject/Template_Lead_Repository on test definitions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/233)
  * [#237 Single IP addresses in Device model specified with standard formats instead of patterns](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/237)
    * PR was create to address [#230 Single IPv6 addresses within device](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/230)
    * Jose explained the motivation, discussion and consequences of the PR
    * Within `device` object only single IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6) will be used to identify a device, the respective json formats are used to define the parameter type
      * The change has only an for API consumers which used an IPv6 address range to identify a device (this is mentioned within the CHANGELOG.md for v0.10.0-rc)
    * The schema in `applicationServer` are renamed and the restrictions of the format with regex are eliminated
      * For API consumers these changes have no impact
    * The PR was merged

* PR [#228 Add GET /sessions endpoint for retrieving all active sessions of authenticated user](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/228) 
  * was set back to draft, due to the fact that the discussions within the issue couldn't be concluded in time and if, would have required larger changes within the PR
  * the issue and PR are postponed to the next release after v0.10.0

* PR [238 Creation of release candicate v0.10.0-rc](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/236)
  * Herbert presented the PR with the updates of CHANGELOG.md, README.md and the change of version number within the YAML file to v0.10.0-rc
  * The PR had already four approvals and was merged live during the meeting
  * Herbert created the Github release with the tag v0.10.0-rc and the release branch release-0.10.0
  * With that the release candidate is available and all interested parties are asked to start implementation and report bugs they encounter during the implementation
  * The actual release will happen most probably in January

* Jan asked to move the user friendly links with swagger editor and redoc as first items and "hide" the link to the pure YAML file behind
  * AP: Herbert will open an issue for that


## Discussion of Open Issues

* [#238 Remove mobile from QoD scope](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/238)
  * New issue created by Randy to get the scope of QoD API more inclusive beyond mobile networks
  * Question up if the scope is then aligned with HomeDevicesQoD or if there is an overlap
  * This need to be checked and based on the result the scope can be reformulated

* [#194 Add Application Function Id (afId) or Sponsor Id](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/194)
  * Issue and related PR currently on hold until it is clarified which information about the application will be already be already part of the autorization token and can be derived from there

* [#173 Add support for DSCP markings for QoD sessions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/173)
  * No update
  * Could most probably be one option to define flows (see below)
  * 

* [#166 Extend QoS Profile queries to list profiles based on specific users or devices](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/166)
  * Potential candidate for v0.11.0
  * Adding another endpoint with `device` parameter in body of POST operation could be one option

* [#101 List endpoint for active sessions of authenticated user](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/101)
  * Active discussion, priority candidate for v0.11.0
  * phoneNumber not allowed within query parameter => operation has to be changed to POST, with body for filter parameters
  * this change will allow then to use complete `device` object to be added for filtering

* [#51 Proposal of IpFlowDescription to allow asymmetric QoS flows and (re)introduce protocol definitions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/51)
  * Issue to be replaced with new issue to rework the flow definition parameters in general (devicePort, applicationServerPort) and potentially add further options, e.g. DSCP markings (see #173)
  * Action Point: create new issue, close #51

* [#47 Include support for /PATCH sessions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/47)
  * "Extend duration" addressed the identified paramter for a "patch"
  * Issue to be closed, new issues to be opened if other attributes of a session are to be updated

* [#45 Need to support ability to configure fallback qos](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/45)
  * Backlog item, currently no use case 
  * Might be part of upcoming QoS profiles 

* [#31 Ensure secure handling of callback URL](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/31)
  * Call back definition are now following the CAMARA design guidelines 
  * Issue can most probably be closed, to be confirmed


## Candidate for v0.11.0

* Note: no merging into main for release v0.11.0 until v0.10.0 is finally released

* Candidates for v0.11.0 (from above discussion)
  * [#101 List endpoint for active sessions of authenticated user](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/101)
  * [#166 Extend QoS Profile queries to list profiles based on specific users or devices](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/166)
  * New issue for flow definition rework
    * will replace #51
    * will have #173 as sub issue
  * Update of test definitions (.feature file)
  * Discussion and update of security schema for all operations (also prerequisite for #101)
