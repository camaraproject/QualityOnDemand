## Discussion of Open Issues

### Issues discussed during meeting

* [#209 Add 400 - Bad Request for an invalid sessionId GET + DELETE /sessions/{sessionId}](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/209)
  * PR ready to be merged, adding generic 400 for the two endpoints
  * The change will go into v0.10.0, patch for v0.9.1 only if someone their is demand for that

* [#204 Move the "description" out of "allOf"-declaration](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/204)
  * PR #205 ready for final review
  * Swagger editor and redoc are still showing the right descriptions with the proposed approach; "allOf" declaration as workaround still needed even with only one element (otherwise the generic description of the referenced schema will be shown)
  * AP Randy to do a final check with his development team before approval

* [#194 Add Application Function Id (afId) or Sponsor Id](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/194)
  - previous discussion and decisions see [MOM-2023-08-11.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/documentation/MeetingMinutes/MOM-2023-08-11.md) and updated presentation in https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/documentation/SupportingDocuments/Presentations/Sponsor%20or%20App%20Id%20proposal.pptx
  - [PR #217](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/217) provided by Syed, first comment from Eric available
  - Issue and PR open for discussion, labels added accordingly

  - Discussion of the latest comments on the issue
  - AP Randy to summarize the results of the discussion within the issue itself

* [#158 Add linting GitHub actions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/158)
  * Already closed, see above in "Sub Project Management"

* [#147 Extend the query capabilities for Qos Profiles](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/147)
   - previous discussion and decisions see [MOM-2023-08-11.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/documentation/MeetingMinutes/MOM-2023-08-11.md)
   - moved into backlog, excluded from v0.10.0 scope

  - AP Herbert: create issue and relink the PR
  - PR [#216 Extend or reduce session duration](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/216) opened as a proposal
  - Discussion if the operation should allow also to reduce the session duration or only extend it ... some voices to allow only extend. For reduction of session duration there should be an use case presented, which justifies the effort to implement the logic (especially if the resulting duration is less then the already elapsed duration)
