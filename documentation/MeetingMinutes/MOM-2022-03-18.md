| **CURRENT ISSUES** |  |  |
| Issue QoD#1<br>Create a mapping table for qos\_profiles | TEF/DT? | A reference draft has for discussion been published to:<br>[https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/code/API\_definitions/QoSProfile\_Mapping\_Table.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/code/API_definitions/QoSProfile_Mapping_Table.md)<br>\* <span class="s1">**Note**: This table is only an example that can be used within Camara for validating the QoD APIs</span><br>\* please verify and comment through the GITHUB ISSUE your position on such mapping |
| Issue QoD#2<br>Document relevant notifications for QoD APIs | All | A placeholder for the list of notifications (e.g. *session\_termination* notification) relevant for the QoD API family has been created:<br>[https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/code/API\_definitions/Notifications.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/code/API_definitions/Notifications.md)<br>\* currently only *session\_termination* notification is present<br>\* please document through issue if other notification may be relevant for the Service API |
|  |  |  |
| *QOD-BACKLOG* |  |  |
| Issue QoD#3 Questions on QoD user stories | DT | \- comment from TEF under the GitHub issue: We should follow user story template discussed in Commonalities WG for every selected use case\.\- Issue has been closed \- to be re\-opened upon completion of Commonalities User Stories template next week |
| Issue #6<br>Consider additional specs: more network API specifications | E/// | Issue #6 - consider more network API specifications which have QoS support beyond the well-known NEF APIs<br>consider EES/SEAL also within CAMARA scope, but maybe as medium-term objective in the backlog. |
| Issue #7<br>\- Add new endpoint in QoD API to request available qos\_profiles | DT | Issue #7 (*enhancement*) will be labeled as QoD-backlog due to other on-going priorities<br>\- the operation is going to be performed through discovery |
| Issue #8<br>impact of verification for authorised recipient (e.g. UE) on API spec | E/// | Issue #8 outcome can impact the QoD API (e.g. GPSI id vs IP identification).<br>This may be also loosely related to Commonalities Authentication & Authorization standards and [Commonalities issue #4](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/4): the [proposal](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/Commonalities/documentation/Deliverables/UE%20identifiers.pptx)<span class="s1">&nbsp;to identify UEs primarily with GPSI (in any existing format either MSISDN or ext identifier) and optionally with UE IP or MAC.</span> |
