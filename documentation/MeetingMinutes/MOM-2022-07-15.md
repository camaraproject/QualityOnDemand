| **CURRENT STATUS** |  |  |
| *Overview* |  | \* Currently contributed API definition needs to be updated for eg. to incorporate the versioning concept agreed within commonalities. Please see newly created issue [<span class="s1">https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/20</span>](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/20)<br><br>\* Reviews from WG members discussed and worked on using open issues:<br>[https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues) <br>\- topics started to be addressed within relevant GitHub issues |
| *Highlights* |  | \* API documentation is contributed, waiting on review by the group (TBA)<br>\* API code will be contributed until end of July by DT and first complete version 0.x of the API will be on GitHub |
| **CURRENT ISSUES** |  | **Total:14 [Open:3, Closed:11]** |
| Issue QoD#12<br>*\- Create user stories for QoD in line with Commonalities standard* | DT | \* As agreed previously in issue #3, please use the Commonalities User Story Template that has been just finalized <br>  to align the QoD User Stories with the Camara common template.<br>\* Contribute user stories based on template.<br><br><b>Update (15.07) Status : Closed / In-review with following pull-requests</b> <br>\* User Story DOC - [https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/19](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/19)<br>\* Latency API - [https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/18](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/18)<br>\* BW API - [https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/17](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/17) <br><br>**Reviewer: *Support from Intel on reviewing the PR's.***<br><br>**Comment:**<br>-> Glossary DOC in commonalities (in-review) applicable to introduce&define common vocabulary (e.g. App-Flow/UL/DL) <br>[https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/52](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/52) |
| Issue QoD#7<br>*\- Add new endpoint in QoD API to request available qos\_profiles\(Discovery API\)* | DT | **Issue #7 (*enhancement*) labeled as QoD-backlog due to other on-going priorities**<br>\* the operation is going to be performed through discovery,<br>\* could be an additional way of addressing issue #1 (see Vodafone's [comment](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/1)).<br><br>**Status : On-Hold** |
| Issue QoD#13<br>- *"Flow Description" Mapping* | Ericsson | **Issue #13: Enhance QoD API with "Flow Description" already defined in 3GPP NEF**<br>\* Currently parametrisation approach is used (“ueAddr”, “uePorts”, ...) with flat data model difficult to evolve,<br>\* Lose the flexibility to define multiple flows in an AS session, <br>\* Proposal introduces API to define IP-Flows for single QoS session and assigned Profile,<br>*\* Presented on the meeting and will improve based on community feedback.*<br>**UPDATE [15.07]: DT discussed proposal internaly and review provided.** |
| Issue QoD#20<br>*- Reset QoD API version* | DT | **Issue #20:** **Reset QoD API version**\* Versioning related guidelines agreed within commonalities working group, the QoD API version needs to be reset (e.g 0.x) |
