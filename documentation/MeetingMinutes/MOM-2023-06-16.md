## PR [#151 - doc/update-spec-doc-issue-144](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/151)
  * PR is rebased to current main, comments are addressed
  * Previous .md documentation file removed to avoid inconsistencies
  * Discussion about QosStatus enum:
    * The issue came up within comment in PR #155, but not solved there
    * Option 1: use same enum within response bodies and events, explain differences (not all values will be currently used in events) in documentation
    * Option 2: split current QosStatus enum in two, a new model "EventQosStatus" to be used within notification events
    * Decision to go with option 2, as more flexible for future extensions
    * Update: new PR [#167](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/167) created by Jose, will be merged on Monday
  * PR merged and issue #144 closed

## Issue [#158 Add linting GitHub actions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/158)
  * In work by Randy, PR to be expected for next call
  * Cooperation with issue in Commanalities [#232 Extend the API guidelines with a concrete ruleset](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/232)
  * QoD sub project once again as pioneer

## Discussion of backlog issues, scope of release after v0.9.0

* Definition of scope of v0.10.0 (or v1.0.0) should include input from the "Product Team" (in GSMA Open Gateway?)
    * Process how demand from product perspective can come into the scope definition of next release to be clarified
    * Jose will invite TEF colleague into next call to introduce the Product team
    * Objective of the team is to ensure that defined APIs will be implemented by as many operators as possible with the same coverage of the API features
    * Consensus that the ratio between value for developers/API consumers vs implementation effert for operators is an important criteria for the decisions which enhancements should go into the next release
    * Beside "product requirements" there could be technical requirements which need to be addressed

* General notion that the next release should have a focus on stability and should avoid breaking changes

* Discussion of the issues currently within backlog

  * [#7 Add new endpoint in QoD API to request available qos_profiles](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/7)
    * Base functionality done in v0.9.0, remaining functionality in #147 and #166
    * Original issue to be closed<br>
  * [#31 Ensure secure handling of callback URL](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/31)
