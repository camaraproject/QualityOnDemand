## Discussion of Open PRs

* [#216 Extend session duration](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/216) (Associated Issue [#220 Change duration of an active session](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/220))
  * Ready for final review => Action point for all to review and approve or comment
  * Please have a specific view on the description, if it is understandable
 
* [#217 issue_194_PR](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/217) (Associated Issue [#194 Add Application Function Id (afId) or Sponsor Id](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/194)
  * It is still open when and how the `applicationId` will be agreed between API client and API provider but there is common understanding that this need to be an agreed identifier
  * According to Syed this has to happen within an application onboarding process between the operator and the application service provider
  * With that there is a relation to the Onboarding Playbook under discussion within GSMA Open Gateway business stream and especially with the "Operate APIs" currently in design phase within TM Forum to support the onboarding process in case of an aggregator between application service provider and operator
  * It is also possible that the application will be identified within the authorization token coming with the API call, e.g. if different client IDs are used per onboarded application
  * The above points need to be clarified before we add the identifier to the API parameters
  * Syed will get in contact with the colleagues within the Operate API working group in TMF, Jose will provide contacts
  * Decision:
    * The requirement to have an identifier which allows to track the usage per application will be kept
    * The PR will be set into draft status until the above questions are clarified

[#224 Align event notification with CloudEvents spec](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/224) - Issue 221
  * The PR should reflect the latest definitions within CAMARA Design Guidelines, ready for final review
  * Jose proposed to add Ludovic Robert as reviewer (done)
  * Request to all to review asap

[#227 Adding global tags element](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/227)
  * Decision to use "Title Case" for all tags for now and adapt potentially later if Commonalities decides differently (open issue [#80](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/80))
  * With this change the PR will be ready for review

[#228 Add GET /sessions endpoint for retrieving all active sessions of authenticated user](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/228) - Issue #101
  * PR still in draft, but should be - if possible - be part of v0.10.0
  * Decision about which sessions to be returned back to the API client: for now we define it generic/abstract as "all sessions the presented authorization token has (read) access to". That allows to define further details if there are changes within the authorization flow
  * Request to make the PR ready for final review

## New Issues

* [#230 Single IPv6 addresses within device]()
  * New issue from Jose
  * IPv6 address most probaly can not covered correctly by a regex
  * Note: At least for some mobile networks (e.g. DT Germany) already the prefix is related to an unique and will be match to identify the device

All other open issues either in work (see above) or not considered for v0.10.0 and therefore not discussed due of time.

### Release 0.10.0

* Release candidate v0.10.0 to be created after the above discussed PRs are reviewed and merged:
  * [#216 Extend session duration](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/216)
  * [#224 Align event notification with CloudEvents spec](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/224)
  * [#228 Add GET /sessions endpoint for retrieving all active sessions of authenticated user](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/228)
* Target is to get these PRs reviewed and merged until next call on Nov 17th, so that we can decide the release candidate there
* Release candidate will be the starting point for implementations. Release to be expected about 2 or 4 weeks later.
* Herbert will create the issue with this release plan
