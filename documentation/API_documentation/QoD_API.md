# Overview

<span class="colour" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The Quality-On-Demand (QoD) API provides programmable interface for developers and other users (capabilities consumers) to request stable latency or throughput managed by Telco networks without the necessity to have an in-depth knowledge of the 4G/5G system or the overall complexity of the Telecom Systems [[1]](#1).</span> 

## 1\. Introduction

Industrial (IoT), VR/Gaming, live video streaming, autonomous driving and many other scenarios demand network communication quality and are sensitive to any change in transmission conditions. Being able to request a stable latency (reduced jitter) or prioritized throughput from the network can improve user experience substantially.

The QoD API offers the application developers the capability to request for stable latency (reduced jitter) or throughput for some specified application data flows between application clients (within a User Equipment) and Application Servers (backend services). The developer has a pre-defined set of Quality of Service (QoS) profiles which they could choose from depending on their latency or throughput requirements.

## 2\. Quick Start

The usage of the API is based on QoS session resources, which can be created (based on available QoS profiles), queried and deleted.
The deletion of a requested session can be triggered by the  API consumer or can be triggered automatically. The automatic process is triggered either when the requested specified duration of a QoS session has reached its limit or the default session expiration time has been reached (within an example provider implementation it is set to 24hrs).

Before starting to use the API, the developer needs to know about the below specified details:

**QOD service endpoint**
The URL pointing to the RESTful resource of the QoD API.

**Authentication**
Security access keys such as OAuth 2.0 client credentials used by client applications to invoke the QoD API.

**QoS profiles and QoS profile labels**
Latency or throughput requirements of the application mapped to relevant QoS profile class.

**Identifier for the the user equipment (UE)**
At least one identifier for the user equipment out of four options: IPv4 address, IPv6 address, MSISDN, or external ID [[5]](#5) assigned by the mobile network operator for the user equipment

**Identifier for the application server (AS)**
IPv4 and/or IPv6 address of the application server (application backend)

**App-Flow (between the application client and application server)**
The precise application data flow the developer wants to prioritize and have stable latency or throughput for. This flow is in the current API version determined by the identifiers used for the user equipment and the application server. And it can be further elaborated with details such as ports or port-ranges. Future version of the API might allow more detailed flow identification features.

**Duration** 
Duration (in seconds) for which the QoS session (between application client and application server) should be created. This parameter is optional. When not specified, a default session duration (e.g. 24 hours) is applied. The user may request a termination before its expiration.

**Notification URL and token**
Developers may provide a callback URL on which notifications (eg. session termination) regarding the session can be received from the service provider. This is an optional parameter.

Sample API invocations are presented in Section 4.6.

## 3\. Authentication and Authorization

The QoD API makes use of the OAUTH 2.0 client credentials grant which is applicable for server to server use cases involving trusted partners
or clients without any protected user data involved.
In this method the API invoker client is registered as a confidential client with an authorization grant type of client_credentials [[3]](#3).

## 4\. API Documentation

### 4.1 API Version

0.8.0

### 4.2 Details

The usage of the QoD API is based on QoS profile classes and parameters which define App-Flows.
Based on the API, QoS session resources can be created, queried, and deleted. Once an offered QoS profile class is requested, application users get a prioritized service with stable latency or throughput even in the case of congestion. The QoD API has the following characteristics:

* A specified App-Flow is prioritized to ensure stable latency or throughput for that flow.
* The prioritized App-Flow is described by providing information such as user equipment (UE) IP address (or other UE identifier) & application server (AS) IP addresses and port/port-ranges.
* The developer can optionally specify the duration for which they need the prioritized App-flow.
* Stable latency or throughput is requested by selecting from the list of QoS profiles made available by the service provider (e.g. QOS_E) to map latency and throughput requirements.
* The developer can optionally also specify callback URL on which notifications for the session can be sent. <br>

Following diagram shows the interaction between different components

How QoS profiles are mapped to connectivity characteristics are subject to agreements between the communication service provider and the API invoker. Within the CAMARA project, you can find a sample for such a mapping of QoS profiles. [[2]](#2)

### 4.4 Errors

Since CAMARA QoD API is based on REST design principles and blueprints, well defined HTTP status codes and families specified by community are followed [[4]](#4).

Details of HTTP based error/exception codes for the QoD API are described in Section 4.3 of each API REST based method.
Following table provides an overview of common error names, codes, and messages applicable to QoD API.
